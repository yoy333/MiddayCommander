# Midday Commander

A modern dual-panel terminal file manager written in Go, inspired by Midnight Commander.

Midday Commander (mdc) brings the classic dual-panel file management paradigm into the modern terminal with fuzzy finding, frecency-scored bookmarks, transparent archive browsing, and a fully customizable TOML-based theme and keybinding system.

## Features

- **Dual-panel file browsing** with independent navigation and selection
- **Archive browsing** - enter ZIP, TAR, 7z, RAR, GZ, BZ2, XZ, LZ4 files as virtual directories
- **Fuzzy finder** - recursive file search with real-time fuzzy matching
- **Bookmarks** with frecency scoring (frequency + recency) and filtering
- **TOML themes** - full color customization with palette variables (ships with MC Classic and Catppuccin Mocha)
- **Configurable keybindings** - every key is remappable via `config.toml`
- **File operations** - copy, move, delete, rename, mkdir with confirmation dialogs
- **Live theme picker** - browse and preview themes in real-time with Ctrl-T
- **Multi-file selection** - tag files with Insert or Shift+Arrow for batch operations
- **Quick search** - start typing to jump to matching files instantly
- **External editor/viewer** - opens files in `$EDITOR` and `$PAGER`
- **Mouse support** - clickable menu bar and panel interaction
- **Go to path** - quickly jump to any directory with `~` expansion
- **Single binary** - no runtime dependencies

## Installation

### From source

Requires Go 1.21 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kooler/MiddayCommander.git
cd mdc
make build
```

The binary will be at `./mdc`. Move it to your `$PATH`:

```bash
sudo mv mdc /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build targets

```bash
make build   # Build the binary
make run     # Build and run
make test    # Run tests
make vet     # Run go vet
make clean   # Remove binary
```

## Quick Start

```bash
mdc
```

The left panel opens in the current directory, the right panel in your home directory. Navigate with arrow keys or `j`/`k`, switch panels with `Tab`.

## Configuration

Configuration lives at `~/.config/mdc/config.toml` (respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).

Copy the example to get started:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/mdc
cp config.example.toml ~/.config/mdc/config.toml
```

### Example config

```toml
# Theme (loads from ~/.config/mdc/themes/<name>.toml)
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"

[behavior]
# What Enter does on a file: "edit" or "preview"
enter_action = "edit"
# What Space does on a file: "preview" or "edit"
space_action = "preview"

[keys]
quit          = ["f10", "ctrl+c"]
toggle_panel  = "tab"
copy          = "f5"
move          = "f6"
mkdir         = "f7"
delete        = "f8"
fuzzy_find    = ["f9", "ctrl+p"]
bookmarks     = ["f2", "ctrl+b"]
help          = "f1"
goto          = "ctrl+g"
# ... all keys are configurable
```

See [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml) for the full reference.

## Themes

Themes are TOML files stored at `~/.config/mdc/themes/`. Two themes are included:

- **mc-classic** - Traditional Midnight Commander blue theme
- **catppuccin-mocha** - Modern dark theme using the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palette

### Live theme picker

Press `Ctrl-T` to open the theme picker overlay. Use `Up`/`Down` to browse themes with live preview — the entire UI updates instantly as you navigate. Press `Enter` to apply the selected theme or `Esc` to cancel and revert to the previous theme.

### Installing themes

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/mdc/themes
cp themes/*.toml ~/.config/mdc/themes/
```

### Theme format

Themes use a `[palette]` section to define named colors, then reference them throughout:

```toml
name = "My Theme"

[palette]
bg     = "#1e1e2e"
fg     = "#cdd6f4"
blue   = "#89b4fa"
green  = "#a6e3a1"

[panel]
border_fg        = "blue"
border_bg        = "bg"
border_active_fg = "fg"
border_active_bg = "bg"

[panel.file]
normal_fg  = "fg"
normal_bg  = "bg"
dir_fg     = "blue"
dir_bold   = true
exec_fg    = "green"

[statusbar]
fg = "bg"
bg = "blue"

[menubar]
fg           = "bg"
bg           = "blue"
fkey_hint_fg = "fg"
fkey_hint_bg = "bg"
fkey_label_fg = "bg"
fkey_label_bg = "blue"
```

Colors can be hex values (`"#89b4fa"`), ANSI color numbers (`"4"`), or palette references (`"blue"`). Any missing values fall back to the built-in default theme.

## Architecture
Built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) using the Elm Architecture (Model-Update-View).

### Virtual Filesystem (VFS) & Archive Browsing

The `vfs` package defines a filesystem abstraction that lets panels browse different backends through a uniform interface.

**Interfaces** (`internal/vfs/vfs.go`):

- **`vfs.FS`** — read-only filesystem composed of Go's standard `fs.FS`, `fs.ReadDirFS`, and `fs.StatFS` interfaces. Any type that implements `Open`, `ReadDir`, and `Stat` satisfies this interface.
- **`vfs.WritableFS`** — extends `vfs.FS` with mutation operations: `Create`, `Mkdir`, `MkdirAll`, `Remove`, `RemoveAll`, and `Rename`.

**Implementations:**

- **`vfs/local.FS`** — wraps the `os` package to provide full read-write access to the local filesystem. Implements `vfs.WritableFS`. All paths are resolved relative to a configurable root directory.
- **`vfs/archive.FS`** — provides read-only browsing inside archive files. Implements `vfs.FS` only (no write operations). Powered by `mholt/archiver/v4`.

**How archive browsing works:**

1. When the user presses Enter on a file, `archive.IsArchive()` probes the file using `archiver.Identify()` which detects the format by filename and magic bytes.
2. If recognized, `archive.New()` wraps the archive in an `archiver.ArchiveFS` — an `fs.FS`-compatible adapter that exposes archive contents as a virtual directory tree.
3. The panel switches its underlying filesystem from `local.FS` to `archive.FS`. Because both satisfy `vfs.FS`, the panel's navigation, rendering, and sorting code works identically on both.
4. Pressing Backspace at the archive root restores the original `local.FS` and path.

Supported formats: ZIP, TAR, TAR.GZ, TAR.BZ2, TAR.XZ, 7z, RAR, GZ, BZ2, XZ, LZ4, LZ, ZST.

**Extending with new backends:**

To add a new filesystem backend (e.g., SFTP, S3, WebDAV):

1. Create a new package under `internal/vfs/` (e.g., `internal/vfs/sftp/`).
2. Implement `vfs.FS` for read-only access, or `vfs.WritableFS` for full read-write.
3. The panel will work with the new backend without any changes to UI code.
